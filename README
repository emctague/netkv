---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A simple networked key-value store based on GDBM.
    By Ethan McTague

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Netkv maps string keys to string values.

    Usage: netkv <file> <port>

    Terminate with SIGTERM for safe shutdown.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Commands
    --------

    Commands are sent on individual lines, separated by \n.
    Commands take the form: <key>[=<value>]

    Responses take on the form <indicator><value>

    <indicator> is one of the following:
    =      Success, the value of the key set/retrieved follows.
    !      Error, The error message follows.
    ?      Information, an informational message follows.

    Disconnection is performed by transmitting EOF (^D in nc/telnet).


    Special Cases and Errors
    ------------------------

    The error message "!Not Set" will result from failure to assign a
    key. The message "!Not Gotten" will result from failure to get a
    value, which usually appears because the given key does not exist.

    If password protection is enabled, the message "?Needs Auth" is
    sent upon connecting. In this state, attempting to get or set
    values will result in "!Not Authorized" and disconnection. The
    special value "~password" should be set to the server's password
    in order to authenticate, after which "?Authorized" will be sent.

    If locking is enabled, attempts to access special values (prefixed
    with "~") will result in the error message "!Locked". This excludes
    authorization via "~password=...", which is a special case.



    Special Values
    --------------

    Special values, beginning with "~", are used to configure the
    database. The following keys exist:

    ~password

        Empty by default, may be set to a SHA512 hash for a password.
        Once set, new connections will require authentication using the
        correct password (not hashed.)

    ~locked

        Empty by default, when set to "yes" locking is enabled. Once
        enabled, special values may not be set or retrieved, INCLUDING
        ~locked itself. If you wish to disable locking, a third-party
        tool such as gdbmtool should be used. User-specified values
        beginning with "~" will also be locked.

    Compilation Notes
    -----------------

    In its current state, netkv includes the gdbm header via an absolute
    path, and forces the compiler to include a system include directory.
    This is a temporary fix for odd behavior on MacOS and should be fixed
    soon to be platform-independent.
